Contact Management System
This is a simple command-line Contact Management System built with Java. It allows users to easily save, display, search, edit, and delete their personal contacts through the console. This project was created to practice and demonstrate fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Features

1. Add Contact: Add a new contact with a name, phone number, and email.

2. View All Contacts: Display the entire list of saved contacts in a clean, formatted table.

3. Search Contact: Find a specific contact by their name or phone number.

4. Edit Contact: Update the information of an existing contact.

5. Delete Contact: Remove a contact from the list.

Simple Menu: An easy-to-understand, menu-driven interface to guide the user.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java

Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Data Structure: ArrayList for in-memory data storage.

Future Improvements
Data Persistence: Implement a feature to save data to the file system (e.g., .txt, .csv, .json) so that contacts are not lost when the application closes.

Database Integration: Connect the application to a database like MySQL or SQLite for more robust data management.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI using a framework like Java Swing or JavaFX to improve the user experience.
